# Ross Massey Course Catalog

A modern React single-page application that showcases every course Ross Massey completed at UC San Diego and San Diego Community College. The data is stored in structured TypeScript objects and rendered with interactive filtering and sorting controls.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default. To expose it for GitHub Codespaces or a remote preview use `npm run dev -- --host`.

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

The static production assets will be emitted to the `dist/` directory, ready to deploy to GitHub Pages.
